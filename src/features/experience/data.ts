      'Maintained and refactored existing legacy code (class components), fixed bugs, and developed new features.',
      'Integrated TypeScript and migrated the project to Vite, which required updating or replacing numerous outdated npm packages.',
      'Updated Redux and transitioned to RTKQuery. Conducted a seamless migration by using new selectors and old reducers to ensure stable application performance.',
      'Collaborated closely with backend developers to streamline API integrations, reducing data fetch times and improving overall application responsiveness.',
      "Converted styles from Less preprocessor to CSS modules. Reorganized styles and implemented reusable UI components. Introduced lazy loading for most pages, reducing the main chunk size by 75% and significantly speeding up the application's loading time.",
      'Redesigned the modal windows system. Implemented a single container for all modals managed through Zustand, simplifying debugging and speeding up the creation of new modals.',
      'Optimized the performance of pages rendering large lists (500+ items) by introducing virtual scrolling, which significantly increased performance.',
      'Spearheaded the introduction of a modern design system, ensuring consistent UI/UX across the application, resulting in improved user satisfaction and engagement.',

      'This solution was also used for customizing advertising banners and promotions within the application.',
      'The application was built on Next.js. To optimize performance, a significant portion of backend requests was moved to the server-side, with some remaining on the client-side.',
      'Performed fine-tuning of page caching for faster page load times.',
      'Addressed the needs of users with disabilities: implemented themes with high contrast, as well as options for increasing font sizes and letter spacing.',
